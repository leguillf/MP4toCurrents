This package enables the estimation of Total Surface Current Velocities (TSCV) from drone videos.
First, a preprocessing step transforms the RGB frames into georeferenced, normalized numerical arrays.
Second, a wave dispersion analysis algorithm is applied to retrieve TSCV maps at a prescribed resolution and accuracy.
Third, the TSCV results are overlaid on top of the RGB frames for visualization.

The example notebook `main.ipynb` demonstrates the basic functionalities.
